    /**
     * Approach 2: Constant space
     * This constraint, 'jewels and stones consist of only English letters' made things easy for us.
     * We only need to think about 52 characters (for upper-case and lower-case letters).
     * We just need to transform the characters' values so that we can fit them as array (of size 52) indices.
     * To do that, we can deduct 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') from the ASCII value of the character.
     * If the value becomes less than 0, it means that the character is an upper-case one
     * (The ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and 'Z' is 90).
     * We can tweak the value so that we can assign 'A' or 'a' to the 0th index and the other to the 26th index
     * (I put the upper-case letters from 0 to 25 index and lower-case ones from 26 to 51 index).
     * Afterwards, for every character we find in 'jewels', we'll increment the corresponding index of the array.
     * And for 'stones' we'll see if the corresponding index of the character is greater than 0
     * (or equals to 1 as per the constraint: 'All the characters ofÂ jewels are unique'),
     * and update the value of 'jewels' in the 'stones' accordingly.
